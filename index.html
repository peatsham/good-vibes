  <h1>GOOD VIBES</h1>
  <h2>HARMONIC SOUND HEALING</h2>

   <p>
    We love sound. Peter is an intuitive musician who blends powerful harmonics 
    to create a magical soundscape. Natasha is the gentle voice of a yoga teacher 
    who eases the group into a transcendental experience.

        I’ve been teaching yoga for eighteen years. I particularly love teaching Yoga Nidra (Yoga Sleep), which is a healing, deep relaxation technique, where I talk to my students gently to put them into a restful state. I incorporate this with sound healing which Peter does with his crystal quartz singing bowls. We believe that they work beautifully in tandem, optimising deep rest and releasing stagnant energy. We look forward to welcoming you to our “Good Vibes” harmonic sounds sessions.

        The singing bowls present an elemental simplicity. Mixing these pure harmonic sounds into transcendental overtones creates an ethereal space. Lacking the cultural references and rhythms of popular music allows our minds to drift into an alternative dimension where we can perceive a fresh reality. Breaking free from our internal dialogue, we experience a waking dream where we are released from our normal existence.

        Crystal singing bowls originated in the 1980s as a byproduct of the microchip industry, where quartz crystal crucibles were used to create silicon computer chips. When some of these bowls failed to meet the strict standards for computer chip production, they were discarded. One day, someone noticed the beautiful, pure tones they produced when struck and began to use them for music and healing.
